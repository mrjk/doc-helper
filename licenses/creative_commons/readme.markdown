# Creative Commons 4.0 Markdown

On November 25th, 2013, [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) announced their next generation licenses: [Creative Commons 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/40768). By default, these are available as [HTML](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/) or [plaintext](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/41127). This project adds [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)-formatted licenses to that list.

Unfortunately, the output currently varies on different Markdown viewers, in particular when it comes to indentation levels:

* [v0.1](https://github.com/idleberg/Creative-Commons-4.0-Markdown/tree/0.1/licenses) uses tabs to indent text,  might cause some blocks to be interpreted as code (e.g. on GitHub)

* [v0.2](https://github.com/idleberg/Creative-Commons-4.0-Markdown/tree/0.2/licenses) uses spaces to indent text, results in less readable files when viewed as plain text

If you any suggestion on the formatting, feel invited to contribute.

## File extension

There's a plethora of Markdown file extensions, but I have decided to go with `markdown`. Read why:

*“We no longer live in a 8.3 world, so we should be using the most descriptive file extensions. It’s sad that all our operating systems rely on this stupid convention instead of the better creator code or a metadata model, but great that they now support longer file extensions.”*

*“…the only file extension I would endorse is ‘.markdown’, for the same reason offered by Hilton Lipschitz”*
